# ira-Alert-Automation-Script
Automatically create Jira issues from alert JSON files (e.g., SIEM or log monitoring tools). This script transforms alert data into Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for rich issue descriptions and pushes them directly to Jira via its REST API. Ideal for SOC automation, incident response, and security event tracking.
